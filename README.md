# Odin Extra

## Description

Extra projects and exercises that are part of The Odin Project curriculum or related to it but are not directly deliverable, yet for some reason I follow up on them. It's varied content, so I decided not to give it a readable structure. I simply put what I've been practicing during the lessons, and maybe I've forgotten some things, but it doesn't matter.
