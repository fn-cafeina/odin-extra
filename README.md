# Odin Extra

Extra projects and exercises that are part of The Odin Project curriculum or related to it but are not directly deliverable, yet for some reason I follow up on them.

The content is varied, so I decided not to give it a readable structure. I simply put what I have been practicing during the lessons, and I may have forgotten or skipped some practices, but it doesn't matter.
